_(This project is cool-cat Baz Jackson Wachowski-approved)_ 

## This project uses : 
HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, GSAP(for the Silly Billy Bubbles Tour)

## Why I built this :
What started as an OOP assignment in the Creative Javascript course with teacher "Developed By Ed", this project grew as I added functionalities and my own styles. I've expanded on the original basics to include some fun and useful touches, taking the opportunity to further my skills in "figuring things out", which is I find very fun.

## What I've added to the basics :
All original styling is used except for the basic track pad sturcture. Baz watches you (in silent judgement) from the "equalizer room", and the original digital painting of Baz responds to your choice of "beats", summoning the party confetti when you play his favorite track. Baz-colored custom cursors also secure Baz's domination over the app.

My additions to the functionality include the cat area animations including the equalizer-effect, also the volume controls, the clear button, some accessibility needs, some tweaks to make a few things work more smoothly and user-friendly, and a special track to get Baz dancing. While playing, the squares will pulse to the beat and equalizer-like lights will also pulse to the sounds in Baz's Private Party Room. I've also made it responsive to different screen sizes.

## Silly Billy's Bubble Tour
I've also installed my very own **Silly Billy Bubbles Tour guide** to give some bts of the project for those interested. (see the silly-billy-bubbles-tour repo!).

## Instructions for using the app :
- **Press play to begin the beat** 
- **Choose your tracks (at any time, even while it's playing)**
- **Click on the squares to toggle sounds, even while it plays**
- **Up the volume to your liking**
- **Change the tempo to your liking**
- **Pause/Resume or Clear at any time**
- **Mute any tracks at any time**
- **Check out Baz while he's digging your beats**


## Features summary :
- Choose from different sounds and which beats they play on 
- Play/Pause your tune 
- Mute individual tracks 
- Main Volume control 
- Tempo control 
- Clear all tracks button 
- Fun animations that react to what the user does 
- A brief tour of the app, provided by The Silly Billy Bubbles Tour, which you can close and restart at any time.


### What I've learned and future development : 
At the point of developing this app, I was more familiar with functional JavaScript so this was a much-needed OOP practice project. Becoming oriented with Object Oriented structure, adding functionality and getting everything to work together was a great experience. It also furthered my knowledge of handling audio files and associated methods. At the time, I was deep-diving into CSS and having fun with my personal projects increases my motivation to figure out and learn whatever I need to to make things work how I want them to.

I have checked this app with the WAVE accessibility extension, but I would also like to check it using a screen reader. I am very sure some ARIA properties would benefit the accessibility of this app, as well as the Silly Billy Bubbles Tour. Also, I think this project would be useful broken down into components using React so they can be easily reused separately. That is on my extensive task list.
