See if Baz will dig your beats on this mini music track maker using OOP JS

Please enjoy my little OOP practice (which is cool-cat Baz Jackson Wachowski approved)! 

Starting from a project in the Creative Javascript course with teacher "DevelopedByEd" using a Constructor Class as the structure,
I expanded on it to include some fun and useful touches, taking the opportunity to further my skills in "figuring things out". Which is a pretty fun skill to have, if I do say so myself.

The styling is original. The header has some fun with the title section, and the original painting of Baz responds to your choice of "beats".
If you choose to use a certain track, he will chill with the beat, and if he gets a good groove on, he'll don his favorite garment and summon the confetti.
Otherwise, he just watches your choices, silently but with a hint of judgement.

The different tracks provide options for sounds, and pressing play will begin the counting of the beat. 
Click on the squares when you want a certain sound to occur, and when it is played, the square will pulse and create an equalizer-like reaction in Baz's Private Party Room. 
You can mute and unmute tracks, and change the tempo and tracks, even as it plays.
Press the Stop button to stop, Play again to resume, and Clear will reset everything except for the mute buttons and Baz's outfit. Because he says so.

This project is screen size responsive, and was a fun learning/practice experience. 

Enjoy!
