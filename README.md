See if Baz will dig your beats on this mini music track maker using OOP JS

Please enjoy my little OOP practice (which is cool-cat Baz Jackson Wachowski-approved)! 

Starting from a tutorial project in the Creative Javascript course with teacher "DevelopedByEd" using the constructor class structure,
I expanded on it to include some fun and useful touches, taking the opportunity to further my skills in "figuring things out", which is I find pretty fun.

The styling of it is original except for having square beat markers, which I also made my own stying adjustments to. I had some fun with the title section, and the original digital painting of Baz responds to your choice of "beats".

*If you choose to use a certain track(guess which), he will start to get with the beat, and if he gets a good groove on, he'll don his party garb and summon the confetti.
Otherwise, he just watches your choices silently (but with a hint of judgment).

My additions to the functionality include the cat area animations including the equalizer-effect, the clear button, some tweaks to make a few things work smoother, and a special track to get Baz dancing.

- Choose your tracks (at any time, even while it's playing)
- Click on the squares to toggle sounds, even while it plays
- Press play to begin the beat 
- Change the tempo to your liking
- Pause/Resume or Clear at any time
- Mute any tracks at any time

When it is played, the square will pulse and an equalizer-like reaction in Baz's Private Party Room will follow the beat. 

This project is screen-size responsive, and was a fun learning/practice experience. 

Please enjoy! Thanks for checking it out!
